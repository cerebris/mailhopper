# Declare your gem's dependencies in mailhopper.gemspec.
# Bundler will treat runtime dependencies like base dependencies, and
# development dependencies will be added by default to the :development group.
gemspec

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# Mailhopper is compatible with rails >= 4, but that does not work with Ruby < 1.9. So, to allow CI builds on those versions,
# we gotta stick with the 3.x line.
